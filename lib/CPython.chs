-- | Initialize the Python interpreter. In an application embedding Python,
-- this should be called before using any other Python/C API computations;
-- with the exception of 'setProgramName', 'initThreads',
-- 'releaseLock', and 'acquireLock'. This initializes the table
-- of loaded modules (@sys.modules@), and creates the fundamental modules
-- @builtins@, @__main__@ and @sys@. It also initializes the module search
-- path (@sys.path@). It does not set @sys.argv@; use 'setArgv' for that. This
-- is a no-op when called for a second time (without calling 'finalize'
-- first). There is no return value; it is a fatal error if the initialization
-- fails.

{# fun Py_Initialize as initialize_
  {} -> `()' id #}

-- | Return 'True' when the Python interpreter has been initialized, 'False'
-- if not. After 'finalize' is called, this returns 'False' until
-- 'initialize' is called again.
{# fun Py_IsInitialized as isInitialized
  {} -> `Bool' #}

-- | Undo all initializations made by 'initialize' and subsequent use of
-- Python/C API computations, and destroy all sub-interpreters (see
-- 'newInterpreter' below) that were created and not yet destroyed since the
-- last call to 'initialize'. Ideally, this frees all memory allocated by the
-- Python interpreter. This is a no-op when called for a second time (without
-- calling 'initialize' again first). There is no return value; errors during
-- finalization are ignored.
--
-- This computation is provided for a number of reasons. An embedding
-- application might want to restart Python without having to restart the
-- application itself. An application that has loaded the Python interpreter
-- from a dynamically loadable library (or DLL) might want to free all memory
-- allocated by Python before unloading the DLL. During a hunt for memory
-- leaks in an application a developer might want to free all memory
-- allocated by Python before exiting from the application.
--
-- /Bugs and caveats/: The destruction of modules and objects in modules is
-- done in arbitrary order; this may cause destructors (@__del__()@ methods)
-- to fail when they depend on other objects (even functions) or modules.
-- Dynamically loaded extension modules loaded by Python are not unloaded.
-- Small amounts of memory allocated by the Python interpreter may not be
-- freed (if you find a leak, please report it). Memory tied up in circular
-- references between objects is not freed. Some memory allocated by extension
-- modules may not be freed. Some extensions may not work properly if their
-- initialization routine is called more than once; this can happen if an
-- application calls 'initialize' and 'finalize' more than once.
{# fun Py_Finalize as finalize
  {} -> `()' id #}

newtype ThreadState = ThreadState (Ptr ThreadState)

-- | Create a new sub-interpreter. This is an (almost) totally separate
-- environment for the execution of Python code. In particular, the new
-- interpreter has separate, independent versions of all imported modules,
-- including the fundamental modules @builtins@, @__main__@ and @sys@. The
-- table of loaded modules (@sys.modules@) and the module search path
-- (@sys.path@) are also separate. The new environment has no @sys.argv@
-- variable. It has new standard I/O stream file objects @sys.stdin@,
-- @sys.stdout@ and @sys.stderr@ (however these refer to the same underlying
-- @FILE@ structures in the C library).
--
-- The return value points to the first thread state created in the new
-- sub-interpreter. This thread state is made in the current thread state.
-- Note that no actual thread is created; see the discussion of thread states
-- below. If creation of the new interpreter is unsuccessful, 'Nothing' is
-- returned; no exception is set since the exception state is stored in the
-- current thread state and there may not be a current thread state. (Like
-- all other Python/C API computations, the global interpreter lock must be
-- held before calling this computation and is still held when it returns;
-- however, unlike most other Python/C API computations, there
-- needn&#x2019;t be a current thread state on entry.)
--
-- Extension modules are shared between (sub-)interpreters as follows: the
-- first time a particular extension is imported, it is initialized normally,
-- and a (shallow) copy of its module&#x2019;s dictionary is squirreled away.
-- When the same extension is imported by another (sub-)interpreter, a new
-- module is initialized and filled with the contents of this copy; the
-- extension&#x2019;s @init@ procedure is not called. Note that this is
-- different from what happens when an extension is imported after the
-- interpreter has been completely re-initialized by calling 'finalize' and
-- 'initialize'; in that case, the extension&#x2019;s @init/module/@
-- procedure is called again.
--
-- /Bugs and caveats/: Because sub-interpreters (and the main interpreter)
-- are part of the same process, the insulation between them isn&#x2019;t
-- perfect &#x2014; for example, using low-level file operations like
-- @os.close()@ they can (accidentally or maliciously) affect each
-- other&#x2019;s open files. Because of the way extensions are shared
-- between (sub-)interpreters, some extensions may not work properly; this
-- is especially likely when the extension makes use of (static) global
-- variables, or when the extension manipulates its module&#x2019;s
-- dictionary after its initialization. It is possible to insert objects
-- created in one sub-interpreter into a namespace of another
-- sub-interpreter; this should be done with great care to avoid sharing
-- user-defined functions, methods, instances or classes between
-- sub-interpreters, since import operations executed by such objects may
-- affect the wrong (sub-)interpreter&#x2019;s dictionary of loaded modules.
-- (XXX This is a hard-to-fix bug that will be addressed in a future release.)
--
-- Also note that the use of this functionality is incompatible with
-- extension modules such as PyObjC and ctypes that use the @PyGILState_*()@
-- APIs (and this is inherent in the way the @PyGILState_*()@ procedures
-- work). Simple things may work, but confusing behavior will always be near.

-- The given thread state must be the current thread state. See the

-- | This computation should be called before 'initialize' is called for the

-- the @argv[0]@ argument to the @main@ procedure of the program. This is
-- used by 'getPath' and some other computations below to find the Python

  cSetProgramName :: CWString -> IO ()

-- | Return the prefix for installed platform-independent files. This is
-- derived through a number of complicated rules from the program name set
-- with 'setProgramName' and some environment variables; for example, if the
-- program name is @\"\/usr\/local\/bin\/python\"@, the prefix is
-- @\"\/usr\/local\"@. This corresponds to the @prefix@ variable in the
-- top-level Makefile and the /--prefix/ argument to the @configure@ script
-- at build time. The value is available to Python code as @sys.prefix@. It
-- is only useful on UNIX. See also 'getExecPrefix'.
getPrefix :: IO Text
getPrefix = pyGetPrefix >>= peekTextW

foreign import ccall safe "hscpython-shim.h Py_GetPrefix"
  pyGetPrefix :: IO CWString

-- | Return the /exec-prefix/ for installed platform-/dependent/ files. This
-- is derived through a number of complicated rules from the program name
-- set with setProgramName' and some environment variables; for example, if
-- the program name is @\"\/usr\/local\/bin\/python\"@, the exec-prefix is
-- @\"\/usr\/local\"@. This corresponds to the @exec_prefix@ variable in the
-- top-level Makefile and the /--exec-prefix/ argument to the @configure@
-- script at build time. The value is available to Python code as
-- @sys.exec_prefix@. It is only useful on UNIX.
--
-- Background: The exec-prefix differs from the prefix when platform
-- dependent files (such as executables and shared libraries) are installed
-- in a different directory tree. In a typical installation, platform
-- dependent files may be installed in the @\/usr\/local\/plat@ subtree while
-- platform independent may be installed in @\/usr\/local@.
--
-- Generally speaking, a platform is a combination of hardware and software
-- families, e.g. Sparc machines running the Solaris 2.x operating system
-- are considered the same platform, but Intel machines running Solaris
-- 2.x are another platform, and Intel machines running Linux are yet
-- another platform. Different major revisions of the same operating system
-- generally also form different platforms. Non-UNIX operating systems are a
-- different story; the installation strategies on those systems are so
-- different that the prefix and exec-prefix are meaningless, and set to the
-- empty string. Note that compiled Python bytecode files are platform
-- independent (but not independent from the Python version by which they
-- were compiled!).
--
-- System administrators will know how to configure the @mount@ or @automount@
-- programs to share @\/usr\/local@ between platforms while having
-- @\/usr\/local\/plat@ be a different filesystem for each platform.
getExecPrefix :: IO Text

foreign import ccall safe "hscpython-shim.h Py_GetExecPrefix"
  pyGetExecPrefix :: IO CWString

-- | Return the full program name of the Python executable; this is computed
-- as a side-effect of deriving the default module search path from the

getProgramFullPath :: IO Text
getProgramFullPath = pyGetProgramFullPath >>= peekTextW

foreign import ccall safe "hscpython-shim.h Py_GetProgramFullPath"
  pyGetProgramFullPath :: IO CWString

-- | Return the default module search path; this is computed from the
-- program name (set by 'setProgramName' above) and some environment
-- variables. The returned string consists of a series of directory names
-- separated by a platform dependent delimiter character. The delimiter
-- character is @\':\'@ on Unix and Mac OS X, @\';\'@ on Windows. The value
-- is available to Python code as the list @sys.path@, which may be modified

-- @
--  \"3.0a5+ (py3k:63103M, May 12 2008, 00:53:55) \\n[GCC 4.2.3]\"
-- @
--
-- The first word (up to the first space character) is the current Python
-- version; the first three characters are the major and minor version
-- separated by a period. The value is available to Python code as
-- @sys.version@.
{# fun Py_GetVersion as getVersion
  {} -> `Text' peekText* #}

-- | Return the platform identifier for the current platform. On Unix, this
-- is formed from the &#x201c;official&#x201d; name of the operating system,
-- converted to lower case, followed by the major revision number; e.g., for
-- Solaris 2.x, which is also known as SunOS 5.x, the value is @\"sunos5\"@.
-- On Mac OS X, it is @\"darwin\"@. On Windows, it is @\"win\"@. The value
-- is available to Python code as @sys.platform@.
{# fun Py_GetPlatform as getPlatform
  {} -> `Text' peekText* #}

-- | Return the official copyright string for the current Python version,
-- for example
--
-- @
--  \"Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam\"
-- @
--
-- The value is available to Python code as @sys.copyright@.
{# fun Py_GetCopyright as getCopyright
  {} -> `Text' peekText* #}

-- | Return an indication of the compiler used to build the current Python
-- version, in square brackets, for example:
--
-- @
--  \"[GCC 2.7.2.2]\"
-- @
--
-- The value is available to Python code as part of the variable
-- @sys.version@.
{# fun Py_GetCompiler as getCompiler
  {} -> `Text' peekText* #}

-- | Return information about the sequence number and build date and time of
-- the current Python interpreter instance, for example
--
-- @
--  \"#67, Aug  1 1997, 22:34:28\"
-- @
--
-- The value is available to Python code as part of the variable
-- @sys.version@.
{# fun Py_GetBuildInfo as getBuildInfo
  {} -> `Text' peekText* #}

-- | Set @sys.argv@. The first parameter is similar to the result of
-- 'getProgName', with the difference that it should refer to the script
-- file to be executed rather than the executable hosting the Python
-- interpreter. If there isn&#x2019;t a script that will be run, the first
-- parameter can be an empty string. If this function fails to initialize
-- @sys.argv@, a fatal condition is signalled using @Py_FatalError()@.
--
-- This function also prepends the executed script&#x2019;s path to
-- @sys.path@. If no script is executed (in the case of calling @python -c@
-- or just the interactive interpreter), the empty string is used instead.
